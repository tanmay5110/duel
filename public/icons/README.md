# PWA Icons

Place your app icons here:

- **icon-192x192.png** - Required for PWA (192x192 pixels)
- **icon-512x512.png** - Required for PWA (512x512 pixels)

## Temporary Solution:
The app will work without custom icons for now. You can create icons later using:
- https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
- https://realfavicongenerator.net
- Or design custom icons in Figma/Canva

## Icon Design Tips:
- Use the 💕 or 🎮 emoji as inspiration
- Purple/Pink gradient background (#A855F7 to #EC4899)
- Keep it simple and recognizable
- Make it look good at small sizes
